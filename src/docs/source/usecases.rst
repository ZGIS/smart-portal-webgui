#10 - Lucene/Angular Google type search and display underpinning all searches/discovery paths
  Summary: All search queries, the categories/icons dashboard menus or the free search form with the map,
  are built upon a specialised query syntax: the Lucene query syntax. To forge specific queries you can employ following fields:

  - `keywords`: classic keyword in the sense that datasets, articles, reports or models are tagged with keywords describing the content
  - `title`: The title of the dataset, report, article or model
  - `abstrakt`: Intentional typo, as "abstract" is a reserved word in most programming languages, apologies for the inconvenience. We mean the abstract, or exec summary type of brief description at
    the top of reports and research articles.
  - `smartCategory`: a specific keyword type for this portal, which is from a controlled list to improve visibility in the portal. The
    list is was generated: 2017-04-19 from Excel GW portal list of icons new structure 20170317.xlsx / Worksheet: science domain categories
  - `topicCategory`: one of the ISO/ANZLIC TopicCategory values for MD_Metadata:
    `environment`, `inlandWaters`, `geoscientificInformation`, `farming`, `biota`, `boundaries`,
    `climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere`, `oceans`, `imageryBaseMapsEarthCover`, `location`, `economy`, `elevation`,
    `health`, `society`, `planningCadastre`, `structure`, `transportation`, `utilitiesCommunication`, `intelligenceMilitary`
  - `contactName`: The name of a contact person associated with the record. Beyond beinf point of contact this person could also be
    have one or more of the roles author, publisher, owner, originator, processor or principal investigator (the role type is not indexed by itself)
  - `contactOrg`: The organisation of the contact person for the record
  - `contactEmail`: The email address of the contact person for the record
  - `license`: The license text associated with the record.
  - `lineageStmt`: The liniage statement for the record, could be empty, but could also cary valuable information on the origin and sources.
  - `linkage`: The types, protocols and online addresses associated with the records, often really just a web link to the resource
  - `origin`: Originating catalogue where the resources was indexed from, currently we index `smart`, `journals`, `mfe`, `landcare`, `linz`, `doc`, `niwa , `gns`, `geogovt`
    (`gns` and `geogovt` occasionally aren't availabe through this index due to performance issues)
  - `fileIdentifier`: the Unique Identifier of the record
  - `dateStampText`: as text-based representation of the date as ISO formatted datastamp string
  - `dateStamp`: a number based range index (DAYS_FROM_1970)
  - `bboxText`: a text-based representation of geographic bounding box in the OGC WKT format
  - `catch_all`: a text-based wildcard-type field that searches all text-based indices from above, but doesn't distinguish between the fields, thus "catch all"

  A query typically consists of a field + ":" (colon) + search text.

  Search for word "hydro" in the title field

  - `title: hydro`

  Search for phrase "hydro geo" in the title field

  - `title: "hydro geo"`

  Search for phrase "hydro geo" in the title field AND the phrase "quick fox" in the abstrakt field.

  - `title:"hydro geo" AND abstrakt:"quick fox"`

  Search for either the phrase "hydro geo" in the title field AND the phrase "quick fox" in the abstrakt field, or the word "fox" in the title field.

  - `(title:"hydro geo" AND abstrakt:"quick fox") OR title:fox`

  Search for word "hydro" and NOT "geo" in the title field.

  - `title:hydro -title:geo`

  You can use so called wildcards (i.e. "*") for finding matches.

  Search for any word that starts with "hydro" in the title field.

  - `title:hydro*`

  Search for any word that starts with "hydro" and ends with geo in the title field.

  - `title:hydro*geo`

  Note that Lucene doesn't support using a symbol as the first character of a `*search`.
  Execpt as you will observe in the free map search `*:*` as default query all

  Also, if you'd like to omit the field, it will be assumed per default to query over all available fields.
  This would implicitly be a query of `*:<your text>`, however, to make this explicit we add the `catch_all` field, which does
  exactly that, catching queries for all text-based fields.

  Proximity matching, words that are close to each other in the text, but not necesserily directly next to each other.
  Search for "hydro geo" within 4 words from each other.

  - `"hydro geo"~4`

  Range Searches or Range Queries allow search for documents where the field(s) values are between a lower and an upper bound.
  Range Queries can be inclusive or exclusive of the upper and lower bounds. Sorting is done lexicographically.

  - `dateStamp:[20020101 TO 20030101]`

  We made this date search functionality more accessible, as separate ISO date fromDate and toDate search parameters, e.g. like so:

  - `...index-url?query=fromDate=1970-01-01&toDate=2017-04-24`

  Logical (Boolean) operators and parentheses can be used to group, combine and negate query parts:
  To search for all documents with "geo" in the title field but must not have "hydro":

  - `(NOT title:hydro) AND title:geo`

  Boosting of parts of your query:
  Query-time boosts allow specifying which terms/Â­clauses are "more important". The higher the boost factor,
  the more relevant the term will be, and therefore the higher the corresponding document scores.

  A typical boosting technique is assigning higher boosts to title matches than to other field matches:

  - `(title:hydro OR title:geo)^1.5 (abstrakt:hydro OR abstrakt:geo)`

  Summary: The configuration file of the indexing component has options for the catalogues:

.. _uc12:

#12 - ingest MD_Metadata, keep track of originating catalog and the uuid
  Summary: We use the ISO/ANZLIC Metadata standard to index, load and present metadata about datasets, models and reports.

  The NOAA ISO Explorer lists all of the fields in the ISO 19115, 19115-2, 19119 standards as supported by the ISO 19139 schema.

.. _uc14:

#14 - index search with lucene text field query
  Summary: see above, :ref:`#10 <uc10>`

.. _uc15:

#15 - index search with spatial BBOX filter  (intersect? vs include?)
  Summary: The spatial search component currently uses 'Intersect' to match the visible map area or the area of interest with the
  Bounding Box (BBOX) of the indexed metadata records.

.. _uc16:

#16 - index search with temporal from-to period filter (intersect? vs include?)
  Summary: The temporal search component currently uses 'Intersect' to match the dates (creation, publish..) or date range (e.g temporal frame for the referenced datasets)
  of the indexed metadata records.

.. _uc17:

#17 - All users can search the catalogues by using a search mask (simple, advanced) and retrieve lists of items (documents, datasets)
  Summary: The search form provides fileds for a text query (which can be simple, but can also utilise the buffed Lucene syntax),
  temporal filter (from-to time range) and the visible map extent as a spatial filter (only lists results that intersect with the visible map extent).

.. _uc18:

#18 - Every search is bookmarkable and the link can be shared
  Summary: Every search query on the map and via the categories list the results on a page, where the link/URL can be shared or bokmarked.
  Loading the same URL will list the same results and map extent again.

.. _#OWCCollections:

#OWCCollections
---------------

We use the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Services Context Document (OWS Context), in the following only referred to as OWC,
as main bundling mechanism to reference metadata records, file uploads and datasets, as well as data services and web links.
The OWC standard was created to allow a set of configured information resources (service set) to be passed between applications primarily as a collection of services.
Here we use it to pass around and keep track of data, metadata and services and links. Currently we only support the OWC GeoJson encoding.
