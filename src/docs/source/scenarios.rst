Overview
========

The Groundwater Hub is a web portal to enable science staff and stakeholders alike to discover, visualize, explore
and publish groundwater-related data set and respective metadata for New Zealand. This portal for 3D and 4D groundwater
information builds upon existing New Zealand and European systems to meet the needs of stakeholders in terms of
open access, interoperability and ease of use.

Our direct stakeholders are: the New Zealand regional councils, Iwi and Maori Groups and in a broader sense
the "community" (community values) in New Zealand â€“ these are the target audience for uptake and our measure,
it must be applied in New Zealand to be successful.

The main goal of this web platform is the dissemination of research outputs, which is
"The act of spreading something, especially information", for the delivery of datasets from other research
as well as corresponding metadata and uncertainties.

Iterative consultation with stakeholders will be undertaken to refine design of web portal and to scope
functionality for 3D data visualisation and transfer solutions. A user-friendly graphical user interface
and platform-independent processing tools will be made available.  It will become a gateway into 3D geological
models and foster consistency in geological mapping terms and interpretation.

  preferably with image ... They will be supported to provide ISO metadata compliant information and minimal description ...
  also be supported to link data sets, reports and models into their case study ... also be supported to suggest

  - :ref:`#UploadHandleFile`
  - :ref:`#OWCCollections`: to create, edit and 'publish specifically crafted collections as case studies

Lead researcher, science staff or manager wants to control who adds data to his case studies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Scenario:
  As the developer should not be necessary to "administer" the portal once it is "active", users should be able to add
  themselves to the portal.

  However, only "power users", initially manually assigned users, can add other users to their project
  or case study or organisation so other users can add their uploaded data by linking (tagging) it to
  those project, case studies or organisations. The notion of project or case study or organisations as a
  distinct context of collected data and models etc needs to be fleshed out a bit better, but let's assume
  tagging and therefore linking data to such entities needs to be endorsed by some leader/manager/owner
  (initially at least).

  All users can then "apply" on projects, organisations, case studies to be added,
  which needs to be approved by the owning power users (maybe just the owning user actually)

Related Use Case Packages:
  - :ref:`#UserAuth`
  - :ref:`#OWCCollections`
  - :ref:`#DataUserAdmin`: uploaded data belongs always to the user who uploaded and only they can edit/update/delete their
    files and metadata records and case study collections, users can belong to organisations, and members of same
    organisations shall be allowed, too, and some (power) users can define organisation details and member users.
    Users can create organisations and therefore are the first power users of that organisation.

A data owner/publisher wants to know about the usage of his data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Scenario:
  A user who has previously published groundwater-related data (dataset, reports, models, case studies, collections)
  wants to know, if and how of the data was accessed (viewed/downloaded), preferably by whom/where (geo/region ...)

Related Use Case Packages:
  - :ref:`#UserAuth`
  - :ref:`#OWCCollections`
  - :ref:`#DataUserAdmin`
  - :ref:`#AccessCheckTracking`: When data is searched for, results presented/requested as cards or on map search,
    and from those results download or visualisation or editing is requested from a (web) user then this info
    will be collected so the data/collection owner knows about impact, can be shown together with the s?
    (e.g. views/download). When data is requested for download a disclaimer/License agreement might be to be
    shown and need to be confirmed (by click), this information will also be collected as evidence that the
    user has confirmed the license terms and conditions for the download
