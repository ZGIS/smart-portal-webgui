Welcome to SMART Webgui's documentation!
========================================


The Groundwater Hub is a web portal to enable science staff and stakeholders alike to discover, visualize, explore
and publish groundwater-related data set and respective metadata for New Zealand.
This portal for 3D and 4D groundwater information builds upon existing New Zealand and European systems to
meet the needs of stakeholders in terms of open access, interoperability and ease of use.
It will become a gateway into 3D geological models and foster consistency in geological mapping terms and interpretation.
